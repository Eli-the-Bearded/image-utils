Source files for fonts to use with texttopnm.

8x16 9x16 9x14 are all traditional (eg pre-Windows) IBM style fonts.

Each directory has:

* a PNG example of the complete font
* a gzipped PPM file of the complete font
* mkcut  - Perl command used to create `cut.sh`
* cut.sh - shell script to extract each character from the PPM file
