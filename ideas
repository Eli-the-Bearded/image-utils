filter tools:

combine N images, each with an image mask, into one image
split one image into N images based on N image masks
break one image into N imagemasks based monochromatic regions

Filter ideas:

multiple graph lines like that Joy Division album

censor with random black rectangles

mirroring

fun-house mirror / uneven distort

uneven sized (but each single color) circles

hex tiles (each single color) with borders

night-vision monochrome

video cam overlay

cyborg overlay

divide into tiles (grid not shown) with a few tiles distorted / flipped

make a pan-and-scan mpeg, then corrupt the video and pull frames out

progressive (along user defined line) slice and seperately filter

rgb tv color clusters

tv style alternating dim lines

several random circles rotated
